=== ZILF vs. MDL ===

* MDL's concept of PRIMTYPEs and type conversions are poorly supported in ZILF.
  * ZILF puts constraints on the construction of certain types: e.g. a FUNCTION
    must have an args list and body, whereas MDL will allow an empty FUNCTION as
	long as it's never invoked.
	* MDL's <FUNCTION> takes any number of arguments. ZILF's requires at least 2 arguments
	  to form a proper FUNCTION value.
* MDL's word size is 36 bits, and it has separate FIX and WORD types.
* MDL's <LSH> takes its second argument mod 256 and then applies the shift to a 36-bit word.
* ZILF's SUBR and FSUBR types are based on strings naming the method that implements them.
* MDL doesn't allow <APPLY> on functions that don't evaluate their arguments (or FSUBRs).
* ZILF doesn't check DECLs.
* ZILF has no VECTOR or UVECTOR types; they're parsed as LISTs instead.
  * ZILF's OBLIST type is based on LIST.
