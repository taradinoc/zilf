THINGS TO DO IN THE ZILF VERSION OF CLOAK OF DARKNESS

The poor Cloak of Darkness example is now stuffed with things that
in no way provide an interesting gaming experience, but do provide
many ways to test the ZILF library.  Please try these things out,
and email any bugs/issues to jj dot lawrence at gmail dot com.

Note - ZILF-compiled games will not run in Mac Zoom (Andrew Hunter
has been emailed about this), but runs fine in the newest versions
of Spatterlight, Dumbfrotz, Gargoyle, Win Frotz, Unix Frotz and Nfrotz.

SAVE, RESTORE, RESTART, AGAIN and UNDO should all function as expected
WAIT/Z causes 4 turns to pass (you can toggle display of Turn # with DTURN command)


THE FOYER
----------
- Examining the cube should cause 10 game turns to pass
- Examining the painting or card should randomly display a different description each time, not 
repeating until all possible descriptions have been shown once (6 for the painting, 3 for the 
card)
- Reading the painting should pick from three different signature possibilities to display, in 
a 'totally' random fashion - ie, it doesn't guarantee all other possibilities have been shown 
before repeating a particular possibility
- Eating the apple should kill you, taking you to a "quit, restore, undo or restart?" query

IQUEUE event tests:
- A "You looked at grime 1 turn ago" message event should fire 1 turn after any EXAMINE GRIME 
action
- A "You looked at apple..." message should fire 2 turns after any
EXAMINE APPLE action
- The Foyer room's own routine should report if the above apple event is going fire (saying
"The Foyer routine detects..." - a test of the RUNNING? (as in, is this event running?) routine
- Examining the table should cause an event to fire every turn, until you examine the HOOK in the
Cloakroom, which should dequeue it.  Note 'every turn' events do not fire during meta-actions
like INVENTORY.

CLOAKROOM
----------
- You should have to remove the Cloak before traveling west to Hallway to Study

HALLWAY TO STUDY
------------
- Event describing spider should interrupt a wait cycle, ie full 4 turns won't go by
 (test by toggling turn # display with DTURN). Example of RTRUE at end of IQUEUE event.
- Examining the SIGN should reveal both its description and its text, reading it should
only reveal its text.

STUDY
----------
- The random event descriptions here (of mouse and scratching sound) should *not* interrupt a wait cycle.
(There are examples of using RFALSE at end of IQUEUE event)
- Has many containers and surfaces to test PUT IN and PUT ON with: jar is an always open container,
wallet is a takeable container with very limited capacity which can be opened and closed, safe is
a non-takeable container that can be opened and closed.  Tray and stand are surfaces.  Crate is
an always-closed container.  The case is a transparent unopenable container holding a muffin that
can be seen but not taken.
- You can use DCONT command to toggle on and off descriptions of objects' sizes and capacities
that will display when a PUT IN action is run
- You can SWITCH/TURN ON and SWITCH/TURN OFF and FLIP the LIGHTSWITCH to control whether the 
Closet is lit or not.  The flashlight is a device that you can SWITCH/TURN ON and SWITCH/TURN OFF,
provides light when on.  The sphere is a transparent unopenable container that holds a firefly
which provides light. 
- You should have to hold the book to be able to read it.

Note: TURN OFF FLASHLIGHT works, but TURN FLASHLIGHT OFF doesn't.  The syntax VERB OBJ PREPOSITION 
is not supported yet - Jesse may make changes to the ZILF parser in the future to implement
this syntax.

GENERAL
--------
IT should refer to the last direct object you used in a command
HE and SHE can be used to refer to Bentley and Stella after you've 
used their names in commands at least once.
THEM can be used to reference the grapes (the grapes have PLURALBIT)
The CEILING is a global object that should be refrenceable in every room
DARKNESS is an abstract (GENERIC in ZIL terms) object that you can THINK ABOUT.
The RUG is a GLOBAL-LOCAL (scenery in multiple rooms) object that is in both the Foyer and the Bar.

SPECIAL TEST COMMANDS
----------------------
DROB OBJ - OBJ must be in scope. Removes all objects contained in OBJ from play (test of ROB routine)
DSEND OBJ TO OBJ - OBJs must be in scope.  Moves all objects contained in OBJ to the second OBJ
(another test of ROB routine)
DOBJL OBJ - OBJ must be in scope. Lists the contents of OBJ
DVIS - Reports on the current visibility of the BILL and GRIME objects (test of VISIBLE? routine)
DMETALOC OBJ - OBJ must be in scope.  Reports on the ultimate location of OBJ, which will
either be a room name or false if OBJ is a global object, etc.  Also reports on the 
meta-location of the grime object (grime does not have to be in scope).  Test by nesting 
OBJ and/or grime within multiple containers to make sure the correct room is reported.
(test of META-LOC routine)
DACCESS OBJ - OBJ must be in scope. Reports if OBJ is currently accessible by the player
(globals and local-globals return false, as they're scenery). (Test of ACCESSIBLE? routine)
DHELD OBJ IN OBJ - OBJs must be in scope.  Reports if the first OBJ is contained by the
second OBJ, and also reports if the first OBJ is contained in the Foyer. (test of HELD? routine)
DHELDP OBJ - OBJ must be in scope. Reports if the OBJ is held by the player, and if the
BILL object (which doesn't have to be in scope) is held by the player. (another HELD? test)
DLIGHT - will toggle on/off status of flashlight, even in darkness
DTURN - toggles reporting of the turn #.  Use when testing WAIT, looking at the cube, etc.
DCONT - toggles reporting of size and capacity of objects in the PUT-IN routine.  For example, 
PUT BOOK IN JAR could report "book of size 5 can't fit, since current weight of jar's contents 
is 5 and jar's capacity is 6"
